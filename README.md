We are doing a hackathon to help enable quadriplegic friends like Nick Browning and others to be more self-sufficient! We did a talk at Charlotte IoT in January on Amazon Alexa controlling maker IoT projects for home automation. Benjamin Gatti, an active member of Charlotte IoT, was at the meeting and knew the perfect application of this technology! He has a family friend, Nick Browning, who could really benefit from this technology. Nick was a passenger in a high school car accident that left him quadriplegic approximately 20 years ago. Getting hot or cold in the middle of the night is a real nuisance for Nick because he needs to rely on family to make the adjustments, or his other option is to suffer through being too hot or too cold. He also likes to spend time outside but can get uncomfortable because he can get too hot or too cold. He has a powered jacket that connects to his wheelchair, but he is unable to adjust the heat on his own. Charlotte IoT can solve these challenges with IoT and voice enabling technology from the Amazon Alexa platform.

We are going to do multiple projects to help Nick and others. We will purchase commercial products for some of the projects and build stuff and write embedded code and cloud services for other projects. All of our code will be open source and we will post details of the hardware that we build on hackster.io. Hackster.io is helping to sponsor us too by providing hardware and money!  We are looking for all kinds of talents including: makers, hackers, authors / editors, marketing, doer, engineers, visionaries, students, coordinators, market research, creative and other cool people!!

If you have any of these talents or others that can help then we would really appreciate your help!
